  Build docker image from qcow2
  =============================

  For each qcow2 matching the "pattern" in the configuration file:

    system-imaging.images.{pattern}.disk.path

  For example:

    system-imaging.images.fedora-40-x86_64.disk.path

  Then a Docker image is created. See the script for details.

steps:
- name: dockerimage_from_diskimage
  uses: system_imaging.dockerimage_from_diskimage
  with:
    pattern: "*fedora*x86_64*"
